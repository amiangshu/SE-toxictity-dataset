"@destenson ""that's an idiotic disclaimer that demonstrates utter non-understanding of the process of building software""
  
  ^ Not nice. You are new here and are missing context. Mud-slinging is not the way to win friends.
  
  The cross-build technology used here (https://github.com/karalabe/xgo) and @karalabe, who put together the process has an exemplary understanding of build technology. When I started my own journey to bring Ethereum to resource-constrained devices (http://doublethink.co) I had originally intended to work on both Go and C++ cross-builds, but it quickly became apparent that the Go team had no need whatsoever of my help. They had things utterly in-hand. Péter especially!
  
  In both cases (see http://github.com/doublethinkco/webthree-umbrella-cross for the C++ equivalent), we are building GENERIC cross-builds, rather than cross-builds targeting specific devices. Obviously a single ARM7 binary, whether cross-built or native-built cannot be optimal for all ARM7 devices. 
  
  At the **current time**, the better solution **if you really care about performance** is to use native builds, which is possible on nearly all hardware which can currently run Ethereum. The ARM builds, for example, are mainly used on SBCs. Until we have working Light Client support, it isn't feasible to use Ethereum on most really small embedded devices anyway. That work is coming soon, though.
  
  You can check out the Go team's 6-month-long ""in a branch"" process towards Light Client in http://github.com/ethereum/light-client. I just got a grant which will help me keep working towards catching them up on C++ (http://doublethink.co/2016/02/23/we-have-blockgrantx-funding/).
  
  You can read some of my relevant blog postings at:
  
  http://doublethink.co/2015/11/30/first-working-ethereum-c-cross-builds/
  http://bobsummerwill.com/2015/12/24/new-year-new-focus/
  http://doublethink.co/2015/12/31/a-tale-of-two-abis/
  
  The Go team have just as much or more understanding of the issue. They just aren't blogging about it.

  I used the same code in reactjs, when i do npm start I get an error. For some reason it seems like the IPC connection did not work. I would very much appreciate if
  someone can help me on this.
  
  ```

  var version = web3.version;
  
  console.log(version);
  web3.eth.getAccounts(console.log);
  console.log(web3.eth.coinbase);

I beleive the ropsten attack is a 51% mining attack because the blockGasLimit was raised to 500Million. Do we know if its a spam attack as well?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"@Arachnid Yes I tried `estimateGas`, thank you. After a lot of head scratching and help from a fellow developer I discovered the problem: I was passing `bytecode` from the Solidity compiler directly to the `data` field of the transaction. Because it wasn't prepended with `0x`, Ethereum decided that it wasn't hex and re-encoded it, creating garbage opcodes that probably had a loop in it which drained all of the gas.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
