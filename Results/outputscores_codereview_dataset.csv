 1. Remove RK_CLRSETBITS() and change everything that uses it to RK_SETMSK()
 
 2. Change to #define RK_SETBITS(val) RK_SETMSK(val, val)
 
 3. Change to #define RK_CLRBITS(val) RK_SETMSK(0, val)

 The worst part about it is that the actual config loading API (cfgclient.Get) doesn't use ${appid}. Users will have to be careful to construct exact same strings as they use in validation patterns.
 
 Do you have any suggestions?
 
 I'm considering moving this placeholders shit up a layer into the root of the config library, so that both cfgclient and validation rules can use it (e.g. we'll be able to do cfgclient.Get(..., ""services/${appid}"", ...)). But it adds a weird-ass concept to already incredibly complicated API.

 Worse, if the init method goes and invokes methods to finish initialization, if an intermediate value is stashed on the instance, the method can use that value w/out you getting an AttributeError; etc, thus assign once stable.

"funny definition of ""shorter"". 
 Getting the human readable version is done to be consistent with other checks that not only print ""bah, your installed version sucks"", but also being able to print ""we detected that you have version xy installed, but we need at least version wz""
 
 Also your proposal fails short since not all versions of flex report the version as second field. Especially those that are not suitable to build (like 2.5.4 for example) print ""flex version <whatever version>"":
 $ /usr/bin/flex -V | cut -d"" "" -f2 | sed 's/\.//'g
 version
 
 Also while your suggestion works for something like flex (where not much releases are expected), it doesn't account for increase/decrease of the digits in the minor/micro version part
 
 while 2.5.36 will fulfill the test when shortened to 2536 and compared to 2535, a hypothetical version 2.6.1 will be treated as 261 and thus fail the check.
 
 If you only want one single command, and disregard storing the version for printing in the error in case of failure to pass, then one could use 
 
 flex --version |awk '{split($NF,ver,"".""); printf(""%d%03d%03d"", ver[1], ver[2], ver[3])}'
 
 of to be ""shorter"" :-) : flex -V | awk ....

 but now i guess you were actually talking about ones like _POSIX_SS_REPL_MAX which should _not_ be defined if you don't have the optional feature it belongs to. obviously these ones need to _not_ be defined.
 
 as for _POSIX2_FORT_DEV, note the ""if"" in what POSIX actually says: ""If this symbol is defined in <unistd.h>, it shall be defined to be -1, 0, or 200809L."". the little ""[FD]"" next to the name means that this is part of the optional extra FD (Fortran Development). we don't have that, so we don't need to have any of the defines, and it's probably less confusing to just remove them.

 The issue is that data corruption can be sourced by the eMMC and over time can turn into something serious. A large number of small fixes each boot are better than a discovered perfects storm when one has both data corruption and an unclean shutdown.
 
 Android Auto (which boots often) would have an issue with this. We would want to institute one of the following if a full has not been done over some period of time (eg: 7 days) or over some number of reboots (eg: 30)
 
 
 1) on shutdown request, reboot into recovery, fsck full the filesystem, then shutdown.

  We might need to worry about sqrt, but I'd need to profile. I'll try comparing performance to versions that stub out sqrt.
  
  It's not much of an issue on my desktop, where the *total* cost to record the 3 latency derived metrics is ~3us. It's >10us on my Pixel 1 though. That includes re-calculating a sqrt from N frames ago to subtract from the WindowedAnalyzer's accumulator. So there's 6 sqrts total per source frame (3 metrics * 2 sqrts).
  
  All the sqrts currently use double precision, but I'm pretty sure single precision would be good enough. In general, after getting the basics in place, I'd like to switch the double precision math over to single precision where we can.
  
  If we really need to, we could use a sqrt approximation. As long as the approximation is monotonic, it should be good at tracking relative performance deltas even if the absolute value might be off a bit.

  - every time the AP boots, we should have the same default sensor settings.
  - if the AP goes to suspend (S3) and wakes back up (S0) the settings shall not have changed.
  - in S3, and in S5, only sample specific sensors that are needed.

  I tried a few things but I'll keep it as-is if you don't object.
  
  Conceptually I want a ""Future<Boolean> testLoaderResult"" object for which I can set the boolean value without unblocking the test thread (in requestSeedFromService()), and then unblock it later (in onBackgroundWorkFinished()).
  
  Basing such on object on CallbackHelper might not be any better than what I have now; I can't explicitly protect the derived class' boolean with CallbackHelper's internal lock, so the boolean field would need to be handled just as carefully as MutableBoolean currently is.
  
  Basing the object on FutureTask is confusing because the Runnable/Callable has nothing to do.

  It sounds like you've created a new channel for the decoder to inform the demuxer of a config change. If so, one thing to be aware of (assuming you're still using our decoder stream) is that signalling kConfigChanged from the demuxer will result in a flush of the decoder. Many config changes actually require a different decoder, so this makes sense. But in your case, this is probably wasteful. For videos that change size mid way through, we just signal the new size to the upper layers and avoid the heavy decoder flush.

But, if we use CMDQ, we still need to make sure CMDQ can process all its tasks in vblank. Although CMDQ is faster than CPU to access register, CMDQ still has its limitation. In other words, we cannot insert too many tasks into CMDQ. If CMDQ cannot process all its tasks in vblank, we will see garbage line on screen.
  
  In Chromebook, mouse cursor will generate too many tasks to CMDQ.

"Yes, I found the issue when the passwd entry was legitimately missing. I was surprised to see both arc-networkd processes running as root in `ps`.
  
  Under normal circumstances the entry shouldn't be missing, and the risk of something affecting *this* daemon is low. But security-critical code often gets attacked in ways that cause something that ""shouldn't"" fail to fail, e.g.
  
  - Maybe the bad guy can't write arbitrary contents into /etc/passwd, but (on a normal Linux box) he might be able to trick a careless cron job into erasing/clobbering its contents through symlink attacks. And then subsequent calls to getpwnam() fail.
  
  - Since Chrome OS uses dm-verity to protect the rootfs contents, somebody can't get the OS to return arbitrary data when reading a file. But maybe they can get the OS to return an I/O error if the file data is overwritten with bad content on disk.
  
  - Exhaustion attacks can sometimes induce failures that are useful to a hacker, e.g.
  
  https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/255-android-rooting
  
  What if somebody opens up 1023 file descriptors, then runs a setuid program that fails to open the 1024th FD and reacts in a careless way?

"> kill -0 basically validates the pid
  That's a smart way to validate a pid.
  I will update Makefile with kill in a separate CL.
  
  > There's another case here though where the master could be dead but the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master... maybe check the command line as well or cwd of the pid? fds etc?
  
  I believe that it should be considered as unhealthy status of twistd.
  
  For example, if ""make status"" returns 0 for a process running, but unhealthy, then puppet or most of system management tool would believe that it is not running, and the following /etc/init.d/buildbot start would fail at the following check
  
  : https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build.git/+/master/slave/run_slave.py#249
  
  
  We could also update the above python check function, but I believe that the example case you provided should be handled by a separate process checking for the health of a service: ""the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master""
  
  In other words, /etc/init.d/status should return ""running"" if a process is running for the service either it is healthy or not.
  
  If ""make status"" should not be limited to the usage of /etc/init.d/buildbot, then I'd suggest to have another make target for health checking.
  
  However, once buildbot is migrated to service_manager, this Makefile will no longer be used.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1
